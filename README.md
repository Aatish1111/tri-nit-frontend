Topic: Rooting for a good cause
In todayâ€™s world, there is a growing need
for an effective platform to connect philanthropists and NGOs to help positively impact
society. Currently, the process of finding and supporting the right cause can take time
and effort, with limited transparency into the impact of the donations.
 Therefore we want to engage people to give donation so that it could help NGO organization.
 
 so, we want to create a centralized platform that makes it easy for philanthropists to
discover and support NGOs working in areas they are passionate about.
